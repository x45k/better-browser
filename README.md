# better-browser
## how do i use it?
go to the [releases](https://github.com/x45k/better-browser/releases/), download the exe file, and run it.
## i found a problem!
please report the issue to me so i can fix it asap (especially if the app is not working)
## nothing saves when i use it!
this is intended. i do not plan on making caching save unless absolutely needed. the browser is designed to be made for a quick use, then closing so the use of the app is hidden
## how do i quickly delete the existance of the app?
press control/command and ] at the same time to instantly remove the app (the app installed in the downloads folder will still appear)
## talk to me about anything else!
