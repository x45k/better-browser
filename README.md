# updated version at [thz v2 page](https://github.com/x45k/better-browser-v2)
# how do i use it?
go to the [releases](https://github.com/x45k/better-browser/releases/), download the zip file, extract it, and run the better-browser.exe file
# known issues
- hyperlinks (e.g. clicking something in google/bing) not working properly. workaround for the time being: right click, copy url address, paste it into the url bar
- app icon not showing. this is not a priority to fix (it is due to how the exe file is compiled)
# i found a problem!
please report the issue to me so i can fix it asap (especially if the app is not working)
# nothing saves when i use it!
this is intended. i do not plan on making caching save unless absolutely needed. the browser is designed to be made for a quick use, then closing so the use of the app is hidden
# talk to me about anything else!
